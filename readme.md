# AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator

## Welcome

- **[Link to labs (HTML format)](https://az104labs.pejathaya.in/)**

## Security Issue - February 2022

Some Azure training labs instruct the student to use a specific user name and password. Bad actors constantly scan virtual machines and try to log in using those credentials.
Once they login the machines can be used for crypto-mining or other non-classroom activities.

The labs henceforth will not specify a default password for you to use. Please set your own passwords for Virtual Machines.

## How do I contribute?

- Any Candidate can submit a pull request to the code or content in the GitHub repo, the instructors will triage and include content and lab code changes as needed.

- You can submit bugs, changes, improvement and ideas.  Find a new Azure feature before we have?  Submit a new demo!
